LED connected to PWM

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "pwm-leds".

Each LED is represented as a sub-node of the pwm-leds device.  Each
node's name represents the name of the corresponding LED.

PWM LEDs support both mono color and multi color element LEDs. Multi color LEDs
are defined with element-<name> child nodes while mono color LEDs do not have
those entries.

Mono color LED sub-node properties:
- pwms : PWM property to point to the PWM device (phandle)/port (id) and to
  specify the period time to be used: <&phandle id period_ns>;
- pwm-names : (optional) Name to be used by the PWM subsystem for the PWM device
  For the pwms and pwm-names property please refer to:
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/pwm.txt
- max-brightness : Maximum brightness possible for the LED
- active-low : (optional) For PWMs where the LED is wired to supply
  rather than ground.
- label :  (optional)
  see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- linux,default-trigger :  (optional)
  see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Multi color LED sub-node properties:
- max-brightness : Maximum brightness possible for the LED
- label :  (optional)
  see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- linux,default-brithness-model :  (optional)
  see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- linux,default-trigger :  (optional)
  see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- element-<color element name> : One or more color elements can be defined for
  multi color LEDs. Property is type of multi color element sub-node.

Multi color element sub-node properties:
- pwms : PWM property to point to the PWM device (phandle)/port (id) and to
  specify the period time to be used: <&phandle id period_ns>;
- pwm-names : (optional) Name to be used by the PWM subsystem for the PWM device
  For the pwms and pwm-names property please refer to:
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/pwm.txt
- active-low : (optional) For PWMs where the LED is wired to supply
  rather than ground.
- max-value :  (optional)
  see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- default-value :  (optional)
  see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Example:

twl_pwm: pwm {
	/* provides two PWMs (id 0, 1 for PWM1 and PWM2) */
	compatible = "ti,twl6030-pwm";
	#pwm-cells = <2>;
};

twl_pwmled: pwmled {
	/* provides one PWM (id 0 for Charing indicator LED) */
	compatible = "ti,twl6030-pwmled";
	#pwm-cells = <2>;
};

pwmleds {
	compatible = "pwm-leds";
	kpad {
		label = "omap4::keypad";
		pwms = <&twl_pwm 0 7812500>;
		max-brightness = <127>;
	};

	charging {
		label = "omap4:green:chrg";
		pwms = <&twl_pwmled 0 7812500>;
		max-brightness = <255>;
	};
};

multi-color-leds {
	compatible = "pwm-leds";

	status-led {
		label = "status";
		linux,default-brightness-model = "onoff";

		element-red {
			pwms = <&ehrpwm0 0 100000 0>;
		};
		element-green {
			pwms = <&ehrpwm1 0 100000 0>;
		};
		element-blue {
			pwms = <&ehrpwm1 1 100000 0>;
		};
	};
};
